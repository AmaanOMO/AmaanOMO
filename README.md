## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Amaan!

I'm a student at the University at Buffalo, studying Computer Science and Statistics. I'm into full-stack development, AI/ML, and turning cool ideas into working products.

I'm also the founder of **UB Forge**, a student-run developers collective helping ambitious students build real-world projects, explore startup ideas, and connect with mentors.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing volleyball, spending time with friends and family, or watching travel videos. Always trying to live a clean and active life.
